       Isaac and Ryan are good friends who really enjoy the work they do.
       </h3>
       <p class="text-sky-700 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-xl mb-6 pt-6">Isaac started out cleaning pools solo, earning the trust of his clients through consistent care and attention to detail. Ryan was working for a local pool company, but wanted more freedom to build real relationships and take pride in every job.</p>
       <p class="text-sky-700 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-xl mb-6 pb-6">They decided to team up and launch Blue Harbor, built on a shared commitment to honest work and dependable service. They believe good work speaks for itself—and they’ve got the tan lines to prove it.
